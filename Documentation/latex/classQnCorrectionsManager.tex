Class orchestrates the Q vector correction framework.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Correction\+Calculator.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Class orchestrates the Q vector correction framework. 

It should be only one instance of it and behaves as the anchor point between the Q vector correction framework and the external run time environment.

It owns the list of the detectors incorporated to the framework and distributes among them the different commands according to the analysis phase.

To improve performance a mapping between internal detector address and external detector id is maintained.

When the framework is in the calibration phase there are no complete calibration information available to fully implement the desired correction on the input data and on the subsequent Q vector. During this phase a list of support histograms is kept to build the needed quantities to produce the intended calibration information. At the same time a list of the available calibration histograms is as well kept to perform the feasible corrections.

When, finally, the whole calibration information were available the support histograms list will not need to be present and the framework will be performing just the intended corrections on input data and on the subsequent Q vector.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceQn}{Qn}} correction manager supports an optional list of concurrent processes that will each contribute to the final merged results. Each process has its own name and it is expected to get contribution of different running instances. At merging time, only the contributions from instances of the same process must be merged.
